 Davis has chosen Canvas by Instructure as the new campuswide learning management system (LMS).

The service, called UC Davis Canvas, will replace SmartSite starting in fall quarter 2016. SmartSite will remain available for teaching through winter quarter 2017, to allow multiple opportunities for individuals to move to the new LMS--see the timeline for details.

The choice of Canvas follows a campuswide review of what UC Davis now needs from a learning management system
